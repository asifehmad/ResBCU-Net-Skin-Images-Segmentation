# ResBCU-Net-Skin-Images-Segmentation
This notebook provides source code of my [work](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bspc.2021.103137) for my Master's Thesis.

Before running the _My Final Model_ notebook, please make sure you have a zipped file named _Skin Lesion Segmentation_ containing the data set in your Google Drive.
The notebook contains different models, choose your model accordingly.

I am very thankful to [Reza Azad](https://github.com/rezazad68) for the source [code](https://github.com/rezazad68/BCDU-Net).
